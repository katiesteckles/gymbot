# gymbot

Gymbot is designed to allow Katie to do interval training at home.

It makes a loud beep at the start of each interval and rest period, and the length of intervals, length of rest periods, number of repeats and number of exercises can all be customised.

It is made using JavaScript and HTML/CSS, and is my first proper projecc in JavaScript.

# gymbot

Gymbot is designed to allow Katie to do interval training at home.

It makes a loud beep at the start of each interval and rest period, and displays the remaining time in the form of a big clock. The length of intervals, length of rest periods, number of repeats and number of exercises can all be customised.

It is made using JavaScript and HTML/CSS, and is my first proper project in JavaScript.
